CodeBook for the tidy dataset
Data source

This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data set provided contains reading from a triaxial accelerometer in a samsung smartphone.  The signals that are recoded are tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag, tBodyAccJerk-XYZ, tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ,tAcc-XYZ,tGyro-XYZ, tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZat a rate of 50Hz and then low pass Butterworth filtered.  

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied those signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.
