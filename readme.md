run_analysis.R Script Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data

Version 0.9
Franklin Call
run_analysis.R Script has been created as part of the Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data 
training course in coursera

This script will extract data collected by samsung phones on the movement of the phones.  It will 
merge the "test" and "train" data for the triaxial accelerometers.  The mean and standard deviation 
for each measurement is taken.  The labels are then replaced with a more descriptive name.  Then 
the final data is exported to a file called tidydate.txt


Please note that this script relies on you having installed plyr
